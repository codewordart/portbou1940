	<p class="intro">Old Benjamin: under no circumstances would he part with his ballast, that black bag; we would have to drag the monster across the mountains.<br />&nbsp;<br />
	Mrs. Gurland's son, Jos&eacute;&mdash;he was about fifteen years old&mdash;and I took turns carrying the black bag; it was awfully heavy. But, I recall, we all showed good spirits. </p>	
	
	<p class="outro">The word "road" became more and more symbolic. There were stretches of a path, but more often it became a hardly discernible trail among boulders&mdash;and then <a href="fittko05.html">the steep vineyard which I will never forget. &raquo;</a></p>
